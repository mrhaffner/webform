# webform
This was created based on The Net Ninja's youtube RegEx tutorial.  There is a code along portion where he presented a pre-made web form that regex's will be applied to.  I opted to try to copy the webform from scartch and then do the regex's on my own before watching the rest of the videos.  I input the regex's into the input tags as "required pattern" properties. It looks like he is using a seperate JS file. We'll see how mine differs!

Net Ninja's version is on his github:
